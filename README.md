# Downloading and processing SMAP-NASA soil moisture data through R
Through the programming language R and its varied libraries, it is possible to obtain the soil moisture data of the global scale of the Soil Moisture Active Pasive ([SMAP](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/)) mission of [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/). The scrip allows the definition of temporal ranges and spatial delimitations, as well as the conversion to GeoTIFF format.
